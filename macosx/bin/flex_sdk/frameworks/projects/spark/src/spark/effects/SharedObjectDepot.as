/**
 * This internal class is a utility used by AnimateTransform to 
 * store, retrieve, and remove shared objects. The class uses a 
 * Dictionary of Dictionaries internally to store the shared 
 * objects and keeps a reference count for the entries to know
 * when it is okay to remove the top level dictionary entry.
 * 
 * The reason this is needed by AnimateTransform is that we want
 * to share transform instances per top-level Parallel effect.
 * But rather than keep the Dictionary-of-Dictionaries at that level,
 * we keep it in this utility class. We add the reference count
 * to the upper-level dictionary to know when we can delete it
 * (Dictionary lacks any useful isEmpty() capability).
 * 
 * The top level Dictionary elements are stored in sharedObjectMaps
 * by the mapKey passed into storeSharedObject(). The items in 
 * sharedObjectMaps are Dictionaries using the target argument passed
 * into storeSharedObject() to store their entries.
