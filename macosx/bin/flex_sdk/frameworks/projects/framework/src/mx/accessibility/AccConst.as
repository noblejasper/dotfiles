 *  The AccConst class defines constants defined in

 *  <p>Since Flash Player uses MSAA to provide accessibility,
 *  the names of the constants in this file have been taken
 *  verbatim from Microsoft's MSAA SDK.
 *  Their descriptions have been taken with minor modifications.
 *  Keep in mind when reading them that Flash Player is considered
 *  an "MSAA server application" because DisplayObjects in a SWF
 *  provide MSAA information to MSAA clients such as screen readers,
 *  via a COM interface called IAccessible.</p>
