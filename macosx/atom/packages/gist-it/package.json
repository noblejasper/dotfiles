If more\n  than one selection is active, uses the most recent one.\n\n- **Gist Open Buffers** Creates a gist with the content of all buffers in the active\n  workspace\n\n## Using Your GitHub Account\n\nGist It will post gists anonymously by default, to post to your own GitHub\naccount [generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the\n`gists` scope and copy it into the package's preferences (see the section below\nif you have trouble finding these).\n\nIf you keep your Atom configuration in a public repo, or otherwise don't want\nyour token to reside in the main user config, you can instead put it in\n`~/.atom/gist-it.token`. You can then add this file to a `.gitignore` file to\nkeep it out of public repos.\n\n## Preferences\n\nTo configure your preferences for Gist It, open the Atom preferences with\n<kbd>⌘,</kbd> and select 'Gist It' from the sidebar. From there\nyou can modify a variety of settings:\n\n- **New Gists Default To Private (Boolean)** By default, new gists will be\n  _public_. you can change this option manually when creating the gist, or\n  set it to instead default to _private_ by enabling this option.\n\n- **User Token (String)** This field allows the user to enter a custom generated\n  OAuth token to have Gists attributed to their GitHub account. A token can be\n  created [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and must include the\n  `gist` scope.\n\n- **GitHub Enterprise Host (String)** Configure the hostname of a GitHub enterprise\n  instance where Gists should be created.\n\n- **Use Http (Boolean)** By default, all requests are made to the GitHub API over HTTPS.\n  Setting this option allows communicating with an enterprise instance that is only\n  served over HTTP.\n\n- **Open new Gist after create** If this option is set, new Gists will be opened\nin the default web browser immediately after they have been created.\n",
