linter-perl package
===================

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an interface to perl.
It will be used with files that have the "Perl" syntax.

## Installation

* Install [Perl 5](http://www.perl.org/).
* `apm install linter` (optional)
  * If you didn't install linter package, it will be installed on first activation.
* `apm install linter-perl`

## Settings

You can configure linter-perl by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu):

```coffee
"linter-perl":
  # The absolute path of perl interpreter.
  # If this was given, executeCommandViaShell and autoDetectCarton are ignored.
  "executablePath": null
  # Is the command executed via `$SHELL -l`?
  # This is useful when PATH is setup in .bash_profile, etc.
  # If true, executablePath option is ignored.
  "executeCommandViaShell": false
  # Is carton enabled if there are both "cpanfile.snapshot" and "local/"
  # in the current root directory?
  "autoDetectCarton": true
  # This is passed to the perl interpreter directly.
  "additionalPerlOptions": null
  # Relative include paths from the current root directory.
  "incPathsFromProjectRoot": [".", "lib"]
  # B::Lint options. "-MO=Lint,HERE"
  # ex. "all,no-bare-subs,no-context"
  "lintOptions": "all"
```

NOTE: "The current root directory" is the root directory in tree-view
which contains the file opened in the active text editor.
If no root directories contain the file, its parent directory is selected
as the current root directory.

### plenv Support

There are three ways to use this package with [plenv](https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv):

- Open a project by `atom .` in your shell.
- Otherwise (e.g. drag & drop),
  - set `"/absolute/path/to/.plenv/shims"` to `perlExecutablePath` (this way is not portable)
  - set `true` to `executeCommnadViaShell` (`perlExecutablePath` is ignored)

[Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl/) is not tested, but those methods could be used.
